# udacity_NanodegreeDS_project1
Udacity's Nanodegree Data Science course, Project 1 (A Data Science Blog Post)

In this repo the following libraries are used:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- seaborn

This project will use the 2017 StackOverflow survey data to demonstrate the skills and knowledge learned from 2 lessons Data Science Process and Communicating to Stakeholder, in which 3 following questions related to the business or real-world context of the data will be answered:
- What programing language were most popular in this year?
- Who had the higher salary btw the developers with and without the most popular language? Can the most popular language helped the developers get higher salary?
- Are the developers with the most popular language working for smaller or bigger company compared with the developers without the most popular language? What company size the developers with the most popular language are usually working for?

The dataset and code are included in this repo, including:
- survey_results_public.csv: the 2017 StackOverflow survey data, this file is included in the repo as a zip file due to the file size limit of 25MB on Github, to run the code you need to unzip to .csv file on the same directory,
- survey_results_schema.csv: the 2017 StackOverflow survey schema data,
- Project1.ipynb: the Jupyter notebook contains the code and analysis.
- some other python scripts extracted during the lesson Data Science Process to support for data processing: HowToBreakIntoTheField.py and HowToBreakIntoTheFieldSolns.py

The result will help to answer 3 questions mentioned above with appropriate visualization, table, or statistic. Pls refer to the notebook's notes for details.
