Udacity's Nanodegree Data Science course, Project 1 (A Data Science Blog Post)

In this repo the following libraries are used:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- seaborn

This project will use the 2017 StackOverflow survey data to demonstrate the skills and knowledge learned from 2 lessons Data Science Process and Communicating to Stakeholder, in which 3 following questions related to the business or real-world context of the data will be answered:
- What programing language were most popular in this year?
- Who have the higher salary btw the developers with and without the most popular language?

The dataset and code are included in this repo, including:
- survey_results_public.csv: the 2017 StackOverflow survey data, this file is included in the repo as a zip file due to the file size limit of 25MB on Github, to run the code you need to unzip to .csv file on the same directory,
- survey_results_schema.csv: the 2017 StackOverflow survey schema data,
- Project1.ipynb: the Jupyter notebook contains the code and analysis.

The result will help to answer 3 questions mentioned above with appropriate visualization, table, or statistic. Pls refer to the notebook's notes for details.
